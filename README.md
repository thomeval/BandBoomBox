Band BoomBox is a free, open source rhythm game built using the Unity engine. The main gameplay involves players hitting a sequence of notes as accurately as possible in order to earn points. The game can be played with either a keyboard or a controller, and local cooperative multiplayer for up to 4 players is supported.

## Recommended System Requirements
- OS: Windows 10 or later, OR Ubuntu Linux 22.04 or later, OR SteamOS 3.4 or later
  - Note: There are likely many other Linux distros that can run Band BoomBox without issue. Feel free to experiment, but those are not officially supported.
- CPU: Intel Core i5 6600K
- RAM: 8GB (Mainly for the OS itself, not the game. Band BoomBox actively uses around 512 MB of RAM)
- GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 960
  - Note: Many newer integrated GPUs will be able to run Band BoomBox with decent performance, but having a discrete one is recommended for higher resolutions and frame rates.
- HDD: At least 500 MB of free space

The current version of Band BoomBox includes two playable songs. More songs can be added by using the built-in editor to import audio files (.mp3, .ogg and .flac formats are supported), then composing note sequences for them (called Charts).
